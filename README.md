# Magnetic_Forces_Experiment
This project contains allows for the simulation of magnetic force distance relationships between a bias magnet and a variety of magnetic samples.
The simualated data produced is that which is included in a publication for submission to the American Journal of Physics titled 
"Magnetic force-distance power laws for undergraduate laboratories"
